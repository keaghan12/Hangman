# Hangman

This project is a hangman game that I have created.
My objective in starting this project was to learn python.

This is also the first project I am using GitHub for. 
This will allow for me to familiarize myself with Git. 

I have created the game so that it works in the console. 
I am exploring the idea of updating it to function in a window. 

I have looked into PyGame for this process. Wish me luck!
